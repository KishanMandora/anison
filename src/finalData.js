  Some people went to AVIAND's channel, claiming that he was not the original author of parts of the song you hear.
  But HE IS!  I'm MIXING up existing tracks in a way that i find more Epic-Powerful, and that's the same for every Epic Ost Mix!
  BUT i'm not the original AUTHOR of the Music you can hear in this video, in this case, UNKOS CHANNEL & AVIAND are!

  Always be sure to read credits in description & go support the original authors too! :D`,

      We normally do chill music on this channel but we couldn't resist with this one.

      It's more of a Vegeta dedication / motivation song than anything else. So go hit those weights and go Super Saiyan Blue!

Memories of 3rd Hokage and Jiraiyah death, of Naruto saying believe it and sayings he's gonna be hokage, of him getting rejected by sakura, of him at the hot springs with Jiraiyah. Naruto started as a recommended anime and ended as our biggest life lesson. Naruto taught us to never give up on our dream, that we can't let anyone tell us we cant't do or be something, that no matter how hard things are to keep trying, and inspired us ( real naruto fans) more than anything. Real Naruto fans know that Boruto will never compare or come close to being as good as Naruto and will never help us get through life like Naruto did. Watching Naruto was the best decision I have ever made.",

Naruto, Thank you for everything !!
Masashi Kishimoto, Thank you for creating this beautiful masterpiece. From the bottom of my heart, Thank you so much. I know full well you are not making Boruto and I believe that's the reason it will never be as good as Naruto. The feelings and emotional part is gone from that series. Please make Boruto as great as Naruto was, Please continue making this anime, Please never stop creating more Naruto.


The No.1 Lesson Naruto has taught us is to NEVER GIVE UP...Things will be hard and will keep getting harder as you progress. But always remember that there will come a time where you will see yourself smiling.

"When you‚Äôre protecting something which is extremely precious to you,you can be as strong as you want to be." - Naruto Uzumaki`,

This one's from an absolutely legendary anime called One Piece. If you haven't heard of it, go watch it. I will say that the very first time I saw it I thought it was really dumb but after trying again and getting past the first episode, I can say without a doubt that it's an amazing show :)

More spicy stuff coming soon y'all, stay tuned ^_^

This is a cover of the second version of wano kuni theme, heard for the first time in EP892.
Higher BPM and different solo parts for Shamisen, Koto and Flute.

I do not use any sample from the original track.
I recreate every sound by myself.

‚ÄúMy dear brother! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I didn't understand for so long. I put everything on your shoulders. Why is it you who always has to suffer? Why do kind people who struggle every day get trampled over and over? It's frustrating but don't give in! It is almost over so don't turn into a Demon. Let's go home. Let's go back home.‚Äù

        comment: `This song hits different when you actually know the meaning behind it. If you listen closely, one of the sentences where she is humming actually sounds like  "Find your own strength please, my dear run away." So Isabella probably knew about their plan of escaping. And did her best to act like she didn't know. Even at the end of season 1 she let's  them escapce.`,

Isabella: "To live longer than the rest"

THAT SCENE HIT HARD

Edit: Mom I'm famous
Edit 2: Tysm for the likes`,
